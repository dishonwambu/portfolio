			<div class="entry-content">

			<h3><p><strong><u><em>Deconstruction:::</em>.</u></strong></p></h3>
 <p>It&#8217;s a term many Christians (or former Christians) are using to describe their journeys of systematically analyzing and departing from some or all of their faith. While I&#8217;ve never done a <em>full </em>deconstruction, implying a complete re-evaluation of every aspect of my faith, I&#8217;m no stranger to systematically taking apart aspects of the Christian religion in an attempt to make sense of them. I&#8217;ve come out of these phases with my faith intact&#8211;others, however, aren&#8217;t so lucky.</p>
 <p>For the newcomers to this conversation, Joshua Harris, author of 21st-century cult classic <em>I Kissed Dating Goodbye</em>, just announced a divorce, support for LGBT+ marriage, and that he can&#8217;t consider himself a Christian by his own definition of the term, all in the span of a couple of days. That&#8217;s a pretty crazy trip, and not just for those of us reading it. Imagine what it must be like to <em>be Josh Harris</em>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A furrowed brow. “Okay… uh, what about IntelliJ?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh,” a pause, “IntelliJ’s okay; but VS’s Intelli-Sense is honestly superior.”</span></p>

But unless there’s like, one specific feature you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">need </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for your work that’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">only </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in VS, it’s not something you should reasonably go kicking and screaming over.</span></p>

			<h5><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">To the student programmer who thinks their college degree isn’t going to teach them everything they need to know:</span></i></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading about graduates at MIT, Princeton, or Caltech being snapped up by companies like Tesla and Google for their novel research and programming skills is, honestly, a little disheartening. It feels like you have to be a genius, or something close to it, to even understand, let alone land a job in, any field that’s new, complex, or both. And then, if you’re like me, you look at your course requirements for graduation and think, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How are classes like Operating Systems or Client-Server Interactions going to help me understand machine learning? Or voice technology? Or programming video game physics? Or any of the things people are working on these days?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the words say on the cover of life’s most important textbook&#8211;don’t panic. You can put away the course requirements. The fact of the matter is,</span><b> your college degree is not going to teach you everything you need to know.</b></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/subjects/what-can-you-do-education-degree" >What your degree is going to teach you:</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that’s what your degree is for! It is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for you to walk off campus with the knowledge of every language, framework, and operating system under your belt; it is for you to learn the kind of problem-solving and base-level knowledge that will allow you to understand the new stuff that will inevitably be thrown your way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you know this intellectually; I think, to a certain extent, a lot of us do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But tell that to yourself when you see the poster for that AI research grant your classmate worked on where even the research question doesn’t make sense to you. Remind yourself of that when the kid next to you asks about something you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">know </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn’t in the course curriculum. Think back on it when your professor is explaining a particularly niche concept that you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">know </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you won’t need to do the assignment but everyone seems to be following along but you.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve got this</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You’re learning how to learn, which means you’re right on track. Specialization and deeper knowledge are fantastic, but most people don’t start diving into those until they’re at least a little bit settled in their career. Some peoples’ brains latch right onto this stuff, and those are the classmates you see breezing through concepts faster than others; the pressure to be the same way is always there, I know, but I promise you: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re right where you need to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those deeper concepts will make sense eventually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on the class, not your peers or the research grants or the industry, and you’ll be just fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a little trite, but it’s true: everyone starts somewhere. That means that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">who understands more than you, at one point, only understood what you do now. They worked their way up from there, which means you can and will, too. So don’t let yourself stay intimidated by internships or video game physics or That One Kid’s open source project. It’s not that you will never understand how to do those things&#8211;it’s that you’re building your foundation so that someday, maybe soon, you’ll know just where to start.</span></p>

<p>Not exactly the most promising start to my computer science career. 
It&#8217;s a good thing, then, that my career actually started over a decade ago with a flamboyantly late-90s children&#8217;s book titled&nbsp;<em>Make Your Own Web Page &#8211;&nbsp;for&nbsp;Kids</em>.
 The title instantly sparked my attention. I coded my&nbsp;very first lines of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) along with Elena, the book&#8217;s &#8220;main character&#8221; who learns to build a web page along with the reader as the book progresses:</p>
<p><code>&lt;html&gt;<br>
</code><code>&lt;head&gt;</code><br><code>&lt;title&gt;my first Webpage&lt;/title&gt;<br>
&lt;/head&gt;<br>
&lt;body&gt;</code><code><br>
Hi! My name is Dishon, and This is my first Webpage.<br>
&lt;/body&gt;<br>
&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>



<p> This was prodigious, sure awesome...I was hooked.</p>



<p>I carried the book with me everywhere like a prized possession, even when there weren&#8217;t any computers around to code on. After working through all of the lessons the book contained, I recall avoiding reading the very end because I didn&#8217;t want it to be over &#8211; and I never actually ended up completing the final step of uploading my files to a server. This didn&#8217;t stop me from designing and creating web pages locally on our clunky Dell laptop; the coding was so fun to me that I didn&#8217;t feel the need to put the sites up publicly, and once I discovered free web hosting sites like <a href="http://webs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webs.com</a>, <a href="https://www.siteground.com/">siteground webhost</a> it was merely an added bonus.</p>

<p>After switching my major, I fondly recalled the little book that started it all. I found it for pretty cheap from a used book store on Amazon, so I ordered it to keep on my shelf and remind me of where I started.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image" style="text-align: center;"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img class="wp-image-1085 aligncenter" src="../image/download5.jpg?resize=313%2C417" alt="dowmload5" width="313" height="417" /><figcaption><font size="6">👆🏾👆🏾👆🏾👆🏾👆🏾</font> </br>Where it all began. 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽</figcaption></figure></div>

<p><em>I love programming.</em> I didn&#8217;t realize it back then, but I was hooked on HTML for the same reasons I&#8217;m hooked on <strong><em>Java and Javascript now;</em></strong> and it wasn&#8217;t just because I wanted to become Tank from the Matrix or that I liked graphic design.</p>

<p><strong>Programming is a study in logic.&nbsp;</strong>Computers are perfectly algorithmic. As a professor of mine roughly said it,</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If the computer isn&#8217;t doing what you&#8217;ve told it to, it <em>is&nbsp;</em>doing what you told it to&#8211;you just <em>don&#8217;t know</em> what you told it to do!</p></blockquote>

<p>In terms of functionality, there is no subjectivity&#8211;your program is going to do the same thing every time (except for those mornings when you open your IDE and discover everything you did last night has gone haywire&#8230; &nbsp; &#8216;out of control&#8217;) There might be more than one solution to a problem, but each solution is consistent, 100% of the time.</p>

<p>When I run into a problem, there&#8217;s pretty much never a time I can blame the computer. It&#8217;s always me&#8211;and then it becomes a challenge to find out where&nbsp;<em>I&nbsp;</em>went wrong.</p>

<p>Along that line of thinking,&nbsp;<strong>programming is a puzzle</strong>. Albeit it&#8217;s a lot easier to think this way when there&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>not&nbsp;</em>a deadline breathing down my neck, but whenever I hit an error, it becomes a really engaging scavenger hunt across space, Stack Overflow, and time to figure out what isn&#8217;t working.&nbsp;<em>Isn&#8217;t this the most frustrating part of programming?&nbsp;</em>Well, yeah. It is, not gonna lie. But it&#8217;s also 1) the part that engages your brain the most and 2) it&#8217;s the most rewarding.</p>

<p>In his book&nbsp;<em>Geek Sublime</em>, Vikram Chandra describes the feeling of code working as &#8220;a little jolt of joy&#8221;. If you&#8217;ve ever programmed&#8211;even just printed &#8220;Hello, world!&#8221; to the console&#8211;you know exactly what he means. There&#8217;s just something undeniably&nbsp;<em>satisfying&nbsp;</em>about finally nailing down the problem and fixing it; there&#8217;s fun amidst the fury.</p>

<p>&#8220;In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun; you find the fun and&#8211;snap!&#8211;the job&#8217;s a game!&#8221;<div><img class="alignleft" src="../image/img2.jpg?w=760" alt="img2"width="313" height="417" ></div></p>

<p><strong>Programming is brimming with possibilities.&nbsp;</strong>For heavens&#8217; sake, its <em>possibilities&nbsp;</em>have possibilities!</p>

<p>I realize the word &#8220;possibilities&#8221; has been relegated to a rather vague buzzword these days, but it <em>is</em> what I mean&#8211;the possible places you can work, the possible problems you can solve, languages you can learn, apps you can write, sites you can design&#8230; in such a computer-saturated world, programming can put you nearly anywhere doing nearly anything. Remote positions aren&#8217;t all that rare anymore, so you could be travelling the world, if you wanted to!</p>

<p>And to those of us who prefer a little novelty, the thought that <strong>my career is pretty much guaranteed to morph over time</strong> is actually an exciting prospect. It&#8217;s not as though I&#8217;ll pick a language or two to use, settle down at a cubicle, and churn out the same thing for the next 50 years; languages improve, projects change, job descriptions upgrade, and it&#8217;s truer than ever that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-karen-kaplan-went-from-receptionist-to-ceo-2013-5/?IR=T">just getting your foot in the door</a> can open up opportunities in different departments or even fields.</p>

<p>So <strong>programming means you&#8217;re always learning.</strong> Whether it&#8217;s a new CSS attribute to play with or a whole language to learn, or even puzzling out how to use features you already know how to implement, programming is constantly learning and re-learning skills that will make your work dynamic and engaging for the rest of your career.</p>

<p>The computer science industry is hard.</p>

<p><p>I&#8217;ve wrestled with Imposter Syndrome since my very first day as a CS major when my friend asked me, doubtfully, if I was really sure I could do it. It took a full year of classes and proffesional institute training during holidays of feeling like I knew less than everyone else before I finally started to feel like, maybe, I was worth something in the field, too.</p>

<p>Even now, as it&#8217;s internship and attachment application season and I stare at some of the big names like&nbsp;<em>Amazon, Microsoft</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Google</em>, among others despite been big companies</br>
	 my resume, my classes, my love of the field makes it that much easier  and to pursue what brings me joy.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I love computer science!&nbsp;</em>And because of that, because of all the reasons I&#8217;ve waxed eloquent on above: the answer is yes. Yes, I&#8217;m sure I can do this.</p>

<h2>Debt</h2><hr />
<p>Debt? It&#8217;s not great. I would <em>love </em>to pay off my student loans soon, and especially before I get married, because it&#8217;s not a fun burden to bear. Lori is also not a fan, and she&#8217;s stated that &#8220;[Jesus] calls debt a burden&#8221;&#8211;but actually&#8230; I can&#8217;t find that specific take anywhere in the Bible. In fact, Jesus says in Matthew 5:42</p>
<blockquote><p>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would agree that yes, debt is a burden, and as such it would be great to not have to bring that into a marriage; but I would not agree that Jesus has said anything to convince us that we must avoid it <em>at all costs no matter what </em>(sorry, Dave Ramsey!) It looks like he&#8217;s actually encouraging believers to let others borrow from them. Let&#8217;s take a quick path through some logic gates: if letting others borrow from you is recommended by God, it must at least sometimes be beneficial for either you or the borrower&#8211;and therefore, debt must sometimes lead to benefit.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can&#8217;t teach that debt is 100% <em>wrong </em>or <em>bad </em>at all times; personally, I&#8217;d say that, as long as it&#8217;s not crippling you or keeping you from following God&#8217;s calling on your life, it&#8217;s just an inconvenience that would be lovely to be rid of&#8211;but having some shouldn&#8217;t prevent you from marrying, from pursuing God, or from serving others.</p>

		<h2 class="entry-title"><a href="../blog/index.html" rel="bookmark">On Failed Resolutions:</a></h2>
			</header><!-- .entry-header -->


			<div class="entry-content">

			<p>Another year, another swarm of resolutions, gym memberships, and eventual disappointment come mid-January (or early February, if you&#8217;re really dedicated!)</p>
<p>&#8230; this is never how I want to see my New Years Resolutions going, but another year has come and gone with zero goals met once again. I&#8217;m guessing if you&#8217;ve glanced at what your ambitious pre-2017-self wrote down last year, you&#8217;re asking yourself the same question: <em>what went wrong?</em></p>
<p>I set four goals, hoping a smaller amount would be less ambitious and therefore more attainable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be in bed by 10:30pm each night</li>
<li>Wake up by 6:30am each morning</li>
<li>Be in the Word each day</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use social media until ALL work is finished
<ul>
<li>Bonus: find more productive break time activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It strikes me that I am an idealist.</p>
<p>I listen to productivity podcasts (my favorite is <a href="http://collegeinfogeek.com/podcast">College Info Geek</a>!), read books like Charles Duhigg&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Power of Habit</a>, and (attempt) productively creative endeavors like keeping a bullet journal. I love to picture this made-up character called my Ideal Self; I love to consider what habits my ideal self keeps, the sorts of hobbies she enjoys, the trendy clothes and the healthy diet and the immaculately clean desk she has. I may or may not have a Pinterest board for productivity-related things. If you&#8217;re reading a blog post about someone else&#8217;s New Year goals, you&#8217;re probably an idealist, too.</p>
<p>We spend so much of our time picturing places we want to be, habits we want to be building, business we want to be doing; and we don&#8217;t stop to consider the stuff we&#8217;re already doing, just doing poorly. What does that mean?</p>
<p>And it strikes me &#8211; <em>why am I trying to add things to my life when I should be focusing on the things that are already a part of it?</em></p>
<p>We get so distracted setting shiny new goals &#8211; work out three times a week, read my Bible every day, post on my blog at least once a month &#8211; that we forget to focus on making the most out of the time we already have. My 2017 goals were left in the lurch as soon as something else looked more fun to try; so instead of getting better sleep, getting my work done, and reading my Bible, I tried and failed to eat healthy, tried and failed to keep a blog active, tried and failed to hit my Goodreads book goal&#8230; I tried and failed at a lot of things.</p>
<p>So my new New Years&#8217; Resolution? <em>No more new habits. </em>No more new self-induced pressures to do things. Just&#8230; focusing on what&#8217;s already in front of me.</p>
<p>Will I still try things? For sure. I&#8217;ve always wanted to be a wake-up-early-bird; maybe I&#8217;ll try a 6:30 am morning routine (and probably stop after a week.) Maybe I&#8217;ll get some friends to drag me to the gym every once in a while. Maybe I&#8217;ll try Paleo for 3 days again. (Yeah, I only lasted 3 days&#8230;)</p>
<p>But whatever I decide to do, I&#8217;m not going to put pressure on myself to stick with it. For now, it&#8217;s about the life I already have. 🙂</p>
<p>So farewell, Ideal Self &#8211; hopefully I&#8217;ll see you someday!</p>
